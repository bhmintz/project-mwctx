libmspack is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1. `wasm/lzx.wasm` is built from the unmodified
libmspack sources (`lzxd.c` and `system.c`, at the commit pinned by ReXGlue SDK v0.10.0) and `shaders/nfsmw_lzx.cpp` of
the NFSMW-NX repository, with `shaders/wasm/build_wasm_tools.bat`; with those sources it can be rebuilt and replaced
by a modified version.

The licenses of the software inside the package (the NRO and its libraries) are in `release/LICENSES.txt`, and the
source code with its license is at https://github.com/StevensND/nfsmw-nx.
